  <p style="color:red">The full of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is "Shivaji Raje Shahaji Raje Bhonsale". ( 19 February 1630 – 3 April 1680) was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle dynasty.Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.</p>
  <p style="color:red">     Shivaji offered passage and his service to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to invade the declining Sultanate of Bijapur. After Aurangzeb's departure for the north due to a war of succession, Shivaji conquered territories ceded by Bijapur in the name of the Mughals.Following his defeat at the hands of Jai Singh I, the senior most general ("Mirza Raja") of the Mughal Empire, in the Battle of Purandar, Shivaji entered into vassalage with the Mughal empire, assuming the role of a Mughal chief and was conferred with the title of Raja by Aurangzeb. He undertook military expeditions on behalf of the Mughal Empire for a brief duration. Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golconda, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers.

In 1674, Shivaji was crowned as the king despite opposition from local Brahmins.Praised for his chivalrous treatment of women, Shivaji employed people of all castes and religions, including Muslims and Europeans, in his administration and armed forces. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy.

Shivaji's legacy was revived by Jyotirao Phule about two centuries after his death. Later on, he came to be glorified by Indian nationalists such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and appropriated by Hindutva activists.</p>

Upon the death of his father, the infant Shivaji Maharaj was installed as the Chhatrapati of the Maratha Kingdom with his mother Tarabai serving as the regent in 1700. His cousin, Shahu I upon his release from the Mughals in 1707 successfully challenged Tarabai to become the next Chhatrapati. Tarabai then set up a rival court in Kolhapur. Shivaji II served as Raja of Kolhapur from 1710 to 1714. At that time, he was once again deposed by his step-mother Rajasbai who installed her own son, Sambhaji II on the Kolhapur throne. Shivaji died of smallpox on 14 March 1726.</p>

  <p style="color:red"> The full name of  Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj is "Shahu Raje Sambhaji Raje Bhonsale". (18 May 1682 – 15 December 1749) was the fifth Chhatrapati or head of state of the Maratha Empire founded by his grandfather, Shivaji Maharaj I. He was born into the Bhonsle family and was the son of Sambhaji Maharaj I and Maharani Yesubai. At a young age, he was taken into custody at the Siege of Raigad by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, and held captive. He was released from captivity after the death of Aurangzeb in the hope of engineering an internecine struggle among the Maratha factions of Tarabai and Shahu. Shahu emerged victorious in the bloody Battle of Khed and was crowned as Chhatrapati.</p>  
  <p style="color:red"> During Shahu Maharaj's reign, Maratha power and influence extended to much of central and western India, which had then created a strong Maratha Kingdom. After his death, his ministers and generals such as the Peshwa Bhats and their lieutenants of the Shinde and Holkar house, Senasahibsubha Bhonsles of Nagpur, and Senakhaskhel Gaikwad of Baroda administered their sections of the confederacy under a loose coalition under the orders of the Chhatrapati.</p>
